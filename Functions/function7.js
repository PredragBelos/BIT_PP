1. Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?
Write a function named tellFortune that:
takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.

2. You know how old your dog is in human years, but what about dog years? Calculate it!

Write a function named calculateDogAge that:
    - takes 1 argument: your puppy's age.
    - calculates your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years.
    - outputs the result to the screen like so: "Your doggie is NN years old in dog years!"
Call the function three times with different sets of values.

Bonus: Add an additional argument to the function that takes the conversion rate of human to dog years.

3. Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!
Write a function named calculateSupply that:
    - takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
    - calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
    - outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.

Bonus: Accept floating point values for amount per day, and round the result to a round number.

4. It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here.

Create a function called celsiusToFahrenheit:
    - Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
    - Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".

Create a function called fahrenheitToCelsius:
    - Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
    - Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."
